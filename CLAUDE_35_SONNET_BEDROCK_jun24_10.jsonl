And it's genuinely quite ambiguous as to who the stop sign is for as you're getting off the highway. It's not for you as you're getting off the highway, but it's pointed right at you.

I was just talking to somebody at one of the I guess I'll just say generally one of the top five hyperscalers in the world, and they are using a new replacement for the Atom optimizer that is giving them something like 30% savings on compute. This was published open source, the technique is called SOFIA, and it's just incredibly 30% off the top. You're saving like $100 million on the biggest runs. Anyway, let's imagine we continue to scale up and it's a few more orders of magnitude.

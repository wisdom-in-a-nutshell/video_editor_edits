Amelie Schreiber, computational biochemist and AI researcher. Welcome to the Cognitive Revolution. Nice to be here. I'm excited for this conversation. I expect to learn a lot from it. Quick context on my end. This all started with a tweet that I saw you put out probably two months ago now. where you said, here are my top 10   
(20.33) ~~tools,~~ (20.77)  
top 10 AI tools for biology in no particular order. And I read down the list and I was like, I don't know what any of these are. So when that happens, I'm immediately like, okay, this is an area that I need to do some remedial self-education in. And reached out,   
(37.215) ~~I think~~(37.415)  
pretty much immediately to say, hey, would you be interested in educating me in the form of a podcast?

So I appreciate you taking the time to prepare for this and do it. You want to start off by just giving a little bit of context on who you are, what you're doing day to day and what kinds of problems maybe you're trying to solve. And then we can step back again and give people   
(54.933) ~~kind of~~(55.133)  
foundational knowledge. Yeah,   
(57.069) ~~sure. Yeah,~~(57.67)  
I'm an AI researcher and I focus on computational biochemistry applications. I actually started out as a mathematician. My training in grad school and stuff was in mathematics, actually. Started off with pure mathematics and then transitioned into applied mathematics and data analysis type stuff. And then after grad school, I got into the deep learning stuff and started working on more AI related things.

Yeah, I think, and for me, like the biochemistry applications are one of the most compelling things that we could be working on right now. I think other than   
(89.093) ~~like~~ (89.233)  
AGI, whatever that means, I think it's probably the most important problem we can be working on because it's a huge impact on human health. The applications in human health and medical applications are really profound and have the potential to be very impactful and for everyone too. So I get really excited about the biochemistry applications of AI. And yeah,   
(112.857) ~~I guess~~(113.117)  
that's a little about me. Was there anything in particular that you wanted to know about my background or experience? Maybe just the context that you're working in today a little bit would be helpful to understand how it is that you're exploring these tools and applying them.

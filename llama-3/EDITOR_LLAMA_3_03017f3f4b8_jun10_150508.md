Huge. And we're live. Evelyn, welcome   
(00:00:03.077) ~~to,~~ (00:00:03.278)  
to the pod. Excited to do this today. We're going to be talking about all things for mop business equations, a lot of your career,   
(00:00:09.602) ~~a lot,~~(00:00:09.823)  
a lot of fun stuff to talk about. So thanks for joining. Yeah. Thank you for having me. Sweet. Okay. So   
(00:00:15.387) ~~I'm going to do, I'm going to do~~(00:00:16.408)  
an intro on you and then we got a couple of   
(00:00:18.010) ~~like~~ (00:00:18.149)  
topics to talk about there, but if I butcher anything, you'll get a chance   
(00:00:21.772) ~~to,~~ (00:00:21.952)  
to fix my mistakes, but   
(00:00:23.574) ~~I'm going to,~~(00:00:24.155)  
I'm going to screen share your LinkedIn profile here. I know I'm putting you on the spot, but so you. Let's see you on the educations. 


---


#### 00:00:32.701

I love how it says educations on LinkedIn here. So you went to high school, Stanford, obviously like   
(00:00:39.026) ~~great,~~ (00:00:39.246)  
great schools here. Everything about like your profile here just reads try hard to me. And   
(00:00:43.307) ~~I mean~~(00:00:43.728)  
that with respect to try hards on   
(00:00:45.030) ~~my,~~ (00:00:45.130)  
my people, but   
(00:00:46.229) ~~you were like,~~(00:00:46.750)  
you were not chilling even in high school. You're like a junior statesman of America. I don't know what that is, but that sounds really, that sounds like really   
(00:00:52.655) ~~like~~ (00:00:52.835)  
hardcore, like mock trial speech and debate. My girlfriend did speech and debate. I feel like that's basically super competitive. Obviously you did Stanford. And so then in school, you studied mechanical engineering, which is interesting because you were not a mechanical engineer by trade today. 


---


#### 00:01:07.201

And then while you're at school, you were a marketing intern, a design intern, a product intern. So this is giving me, I'm trying to figure out what I want to do, which is interesting because I actually don't think a lot of people do that. I think they just   
(00:01:19.346) ~~kind of~~(00:01:19.546)  
do, I'm going to be an investment banker. So you try a lot of stuff while you're doing mechanical engineering. And so   
(00:01:26.328) ~~I think~~(00:01:26.528)  
that's really interesting to me. And then you go to McKinsey, right? You're a consultant. tech people love to hate on consultants, but you do that, you do the consulting thing, and then you go to Invis Group. And Invis Group is actually cool because, 


---


#### 00:01:39.054

I'm going to quickly jump over here, but they- We have a terrible website. Yeah, the website may not be amazing, but some of these companies are like, I was like, I'd never heard of this company. This is another   
(00:01:48.680) ~~like,~~ (00:01:48.820)  
PE companies are notorious,   
(00:01:50.302) ~~I feel like,~~(00:01:50.662)  
for having horrible websites, but   
(00:01:51.942) ~~like,~~ (00:01:52.102)  
Weight Watchers, Keebler, like these are some notable consumer companies, Kava. And then   
(00:01:56.983) ~~so~~ (00:01:57.063)  
anyway, I'm gonna switch back here, but then you go there, you're there for a couple years, you did some pretty interesting investments there, and then you go to startups. You're just like, boom, I'm gonna do tech,   
(00:02:06.507) ~~I guess.~~(00:02:06.826)  
And so you go to Hay Day, which they, I believe they do skincare, so it's like skincare products and   
(00:02:11.448) ~~like~~ (00:02:11.587)  
facial, like it's almost like a quasi marketplace of   
(00:02:14.889) ~~like~~ (00:02:14.969)  
book a facial appointment. 


---


#### 00:02:16.371

And then now you're at Fermat, where you're VP of finance and operations. And we're going to talk more about Fermat in a second, which is if you're in the Shopify ecosystem, you've almost definitely heard of this company. I feel like I see you guys everywhere the last few months. But anyway, so that is you. I would love to talk about maybe as a starting point, one, did I miss anything? And then two, you had a hot take on,   
(00:02:37.485) ~~I guess,~~(00:02:37.745)  
like careers in general, like career advice. So maybe we start there. Yeah,   
(00:02:42.114) ~~I know.~~(00:02:42.314)  
Thank you for the intro. I feel like I should use it for my future interviews. But yeah, I think my hot take in life is I think the career advice that I got a ton of when I was in college is the whole find your passion, find your calling and go pursue it with all of your energy. 


---


#### 00:02:56.451

Figure that out. And I think as a college student, I frankly had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, which now when I talk to my brother who's in college, I feel like he also has no idea what he wants to do with his life. And so I think it must be a common thing that most people actually probably don't really know what their passion is. And so you're   
(00:03:12.969) ~~kind of~~(00:03:13.150)  
given this advice where you're told   
(00:03:14.290) ~~like,~~ (00:03:14.431)  
go figure it out, but you don't have to get any tools or   
(00:03:17.112) ~~like~~ (00:03:17.293)  
ways for you to actually do that. And so I find it wildly unhelpful. And so what I usually push people to do is whenever people ask me for advice on this stuff is I really encourage you to get out and try a bunch of different things. 


---


#### 00:03:29.378

And I think you could see it on their resume where I majored in mechanical engineering, but then tried out all these different internships in marketing, design, product. And a lot of it was just to get a sense of what's actually exciting for me.   
(00:03:39.889) ~~Like,~~ (00:03:40.050)  
where am I getting energy from? Where am I getting fulfillment from? What's the type of work that's going to be really interesting for me? And   
(00:03:46.771) ~~I think~~(00:03:47.072)  
only from trying and doing   
(00:03:48.932) ~~do you actually get the first world sense of~~(00:03:50.552)  
what is this career actually going to mean in the real world. And so from taking a,   
(00:03:55.336) ~~I think~~(00:03:55.537)  
a travel girlfriend because these days, like taking a random walks for a lot of these different experiences, 


---


#### 00:04:00.401

I think gave me a core sense of what's the type of work I want to be doing, what's the type of people I want to be working with, like is the industry or space that's particularly exciting. And   
(00:04:08.450) ~~I think~~(00:04:08.730)  
that's really what's driven a lot of my career decision making along,   
(00:04:11.955) ~~I think,~~(00:04:12.575)  
my, the last few years of my time here. Nice. So then my question there is   
(00:04:17.915) ~~like,~~ (00:04:18.036)  
whenever you're going through this random walk,   
(00:04:20.059) ~~right,~~ (00:04:20.259)  
trying to develop all these skill sets, what was like the aha moment for you where you realized, okay, this is the field that I just absolutely love and want to spend a ton of time in? Yeah, I feel like that's actually one part of the vice that I actually challenge, where I feel like it's not just trying to find one thing to really come in and on. 


---


#### 00:04:35.675

I think it's basically picking apart the bits and pieces. Oh, I find this type of work interesting, or I find this particular project really exciting. And I think being really unafraid to   
(00:04:44.004) ~~kind of~~(00:04:44.403)  
ask the tough question of what makes this particular thing, project, collective group exciting or interesting for you, and I think also looking a little bit internally at what about this is actually speaking to you. And I think it's almost just like taking notes and taking observations. Okay, these are the elements that I'm continuing to look for. And so when you're, it's almost like two levels, where it's you're A, trying to just get exposure to different things, which I think another term I'd borrow is it's like increasing your black surface area. 


---


#### 00:05:10.930

So just increasing your opportunity to access a lot of different opportunities. And then, so then when you're in those positions where you actually can make decisions, you can actually realistically take your options and be like, okay, what's going to present elements of things that I've actually really enjoyed before and basically could predestine you from there. I love that.   
(00:05:28.485) ~~I love that.~~(00:05:29.045)  
That makes sense.   
(00:05:29.687) ~~Right. So, yeah. Yeah,~~(00:05:33.269)  
I was gonna say, so   
(00:05:34.329) ~~I think~~(00:05:34.589)  
there's one thing I'm curious about with all of that experience. You ultimately decide, I feel like when you talk about that, the thing I'd almost expect is, after all of that experience, I realized I wanted to go to startups. And instead, you jumped to McKinsey, right? 


---


#### 00:05:47.764

And so McKinsey is like, I feel like my It is. It's the great thing. No one's going to question you going to McKinsey, right? It's like very prestigious. And it's going to be like this great, you're going to get the experience, see lots of things. There's lots of stuff you can do there. But that's the route you went. And tech people, if you're on tech Twitter at all, they love to hit on McKinsey or they love to hit on consulting types, which I do have a take on. I think it's overdone. But I'm curious, having done that and now you are in tech, Like   
(00:06:15.711) ~~you,~~ (00:06:15.851)  
you tried all these things and then you decided to go to McKinsey and then you ended up back   
(00:06:18.752) ~~like~~ (00:06:18.872)  
doing tech stuff. 


---


#### 00:06:19.632

Like what, like, what was your take on the value of that experience in what you're doing today? Yeah. So   
(00:06:25.574) ~~I think~~(00:06:25.874)  
my two cents of it is   
(00:06:27.875) ~~I think~~(00:06:28.154)  
you're fully right in the sense of   
(00:06:29.214) ~~what a lot of reasons why~~(00:06:29.915)  
I took the job was   
(00:06:30.915) ~~you never,~~(00:06:31.314)  
no one's ever going to shame you for taking it in a way. And   
(00:06:34.536) ~~I think~~(00:06:34.735)  
the part that they really sold me on was the whole, you get to try out a bunch of different things. You get to see what excites you. And   
(00:06:40.036) ~~I think~~(00:06:40.336)  
that really spoke to me given everything I've said before. But my two cents of it is basically, I think the soft skills and the toolkit that you pick up in consulting, 


---


#### 00:06:49.346

I think it's never overrated. I do think where some people start to become overrated is when you stay too long without thinking about where you actually want to take the career, where it's almost like you're staying because that is the default decision. You don't actually have to make a decision about where you want to do next.   
(00:07:05.377) ~~I think~~(00:07:05.658)  
that's where you've got to start thinking about your opportunity costs and where else you could be in your career. because I do see this as becoming a thing where if you stay in consulting for too long, where it's basically a role where you get   
(00:07:15.374) ~~like~~ (00:07:15.514)  
a ton of really great exposure. You get a lot of great opportunity to just learn new things, try new things, work on different functions, basically give a lot of different advice to people. 


---


#### 00:07:23.800

But at the end of the day, you're never actually the one pulling the trigger. You're never the one making a core decision. And   
(00:07:29.663) ~~I think~~(00:07:29.923)  
that's actually a skill set that is incredibly useful, especially as you move on from your career. Or if you don't learn that at some point in your career,   
(00:07:36.401) ~~I think~~(00:07:36.641)  
that's something that's definitely going to do big things later on. And   
(00:07:40.283) ~~I think~~(00:07:40.644)  
a reason a lot of people end up staying is because   
(00:07:43.165) ~~you,~~ (00:07:43.586)  
McKinsey is a really great place   
(00:07:45.466) ~~where like~~(00:07:46.086)  
you can stay for a long time and still continue to have these great experiences and new experiences and just try out different things. But I think it's something that I would challenge every consultant to think about, or you should constantly push yourself and thinking about, is there another opportunity that's going to be equally, if not more exciting for me? 


---


#### 00:08:03.543

Oh yeah.   
(00:08:04.163) ~~I feel my,~~(00:08:04.745)  
I love that. And I think this is like a good segue into getting into your actual like operating career and startups, because I actually think   
(00:08:11.127) ~~the~~ (00:08:11.247)  
McKinsey, this is true for investment bankers too, as much as tech people love to hate on them. You guys can grind in a way that   
(00:08:17.730) ~~like~~ (00:08:17.831)  
a lot of tech people cannot grind.   
(00:08:19.672) ~~Like~~ (00:08:19.831)  
every McKinsey person,   
(00:08:22.392) ~~like~~ (00:08:22.553)  
investment banker,   
(00:08:23.494) ~~like~~ (00:08:23.634)  
even   
(00:08:23.913) ~~like~~ (00:08:24.033)  
BCG,   
(00:08:24.574) ~~like~~ (00:08:24.675)  
all these types, they're really professional. They're really   
(00:08:27.255) ~~like,~~ (00:08:27.355)  
they're just generally good at the basics of blocking and tackling a business. And they just   
(00:08:32.458) ~~like~~ (00:08:32.538)  
work really hard. And I think that's   
(00:08:34.198) ~~like~~ (00:08:34.379)  
an underrated thing, especially in startups versus if you go hire someone from Google, it's like very iffy not to pick on Google on like how hard they're going to work. 


---


#### 00:08:43.004

So, so on that point on, we're going to talk about Fermat and I really hope I'm saying that correctly. Cause I've been like, I'm actually still not sure if I'm like pronouncing the name correctly, but   
(00:08:50.950) ~~I,~~ (00:08:50.970)  
so   
(00:08:51.509) ~~Fermat, this is where you're at today.~~(00:08:52.990)  
I'm going to try to make sure I get the description down, but my understanding of the business is you guys were founded in 2021. You've raised like something around $25 million.   
(00:09:02.188) ~~I think~~(00:09:02.789)  
you did that $17 million Series A pretty recently. And it's so the tail end from my point of view that you're writing is the fact that Apple privacy changes have basically nuked a lot of Facebook advertising, right? So all these brands for years, 


---


#### 00:09:16.017

DTC, it's just like Facebook ads. And that is the whole model that built tons and tons of things on the internet and e-commerce. And now with all these privacy changes that I cannot speak that articulately about, it's basically a lot more expensive and harder to target your ideal consumer, your ideal customer as a brand. And then two, it's just more expensive. And so what you guys are building is this way to tailor the shopping experience. So if I   
(00:09:41.373) ~~like~~ (00:09:41.513)  
see an ad and I click on it, like you as the brand itself can tailor the experience to who the consumer is, like where they might be seeing this ad and do that in a really high fidelity, highly targeted way. 


---


#### 00:09:51.677

And I think the thing, this is me reading between the lines, so I'll let you correct me, but the thing that, It looks like you let people do as well. It's almost like since you're getting less shots on goal because it's gotten so much more expensive, you're able to really maximize those shots with every time you get an ad in front of a consumer to hopefully be able to convert them. So that is my understanding of what you guys do. So how's my characterization? What would you add or edit? Yeah, that's really not bad. I feel like I should give this shots on goal analogy to my marketing team. I think they will love that. 


---


#### 00:10:21.874

But yeah, the way that we really position ourselves today is Vermont lets you create funnels the way that you create ads. So in a way that I think a lot of performance marketers have thought about testing hack-free and then testing that part of the funnel. we basically let you test the post clip version of that funnel. So given that you have less things that you can play around with in the first part, we're giving you a lot more, a huge arsenal of tools that you can test around with the second part of the funnel. So whether that's bundling, whether that's upsells, whether that's discounting, whether that's a purchase, whether that's just like tracking user behavior, those are all things that with Fermat you're able to experiment with and you're able to experiment with it at speed. 


---


#### 00:10:59.597

So that way you You're able to convert more of your key traffic with landing pages, embedded PDKs, and custom perks, and all of that you can build within less than five minutes with a code per month. Yeah,   
(00:11:10.405) ~~no,~~ (00:11:10.625)  
no developers needed, right? No developers needed. They think that's   
(00:11:13.807) ~~like~~ (00:11:13.947)  
the big selling point of this, where for most teams, if you wanted to pursue a strategy like this, you would actually have to go hire an affiliate dev agency, you would have to tap your actual dev team, and usually processes like that end up taking anywhere from one to three months. Yeah, yeah. So also   
(00:11:28.870) ~~kind of~~(00:11:29.030)  
riding the fact that   
(00:11:29.892) ~~like~~ (00:11:30.011)  
everyone's more cost conscious conscious now than I feel like we were a couple years ago. 


---


#### 00:12:21.480

You're doing a good job. And so I didn't see your, I was watching your body movement and I didn't see it until I had already started talking.   
(00:12:26.847) ~~So,~~ (00:12:27.048)  
so my bad on that. Dude,   
(00:12:28.649) ~~first,~~ (00:12:28.890)  
first podcast.   
(00:12:29.731) ~~Like~~ (00:12:29.892)  
I think you're doing good. Keep going. Thanks man. Yeah. Now I don't see you. Cool. Wait, no, there you are. I see you. That's why I realized there's the feedback going on now that I'm starting to hear the feedback. So that's why you see me, I turn on and off my microphone. Cause I don't know if it's me or if it's something else. Like I'm trying to figure it out. We literally tested this earlier today and I didn't hear anything. 


---


#### 00:12:49.320

So we're at the joys of being brand new podcasters. Yeah. Okay. We'll figure it out.   
(00:12:56.220) ~~Yeah,~~ (00:12:56.460)  
but I think we're good.   
(00:12:57.620) ~~Our, the,~~(00:12:58.562)  
the production team we're working with   
(00:13:00.024) ~~will be,~~(00:13:00.303)  
we'll be happy. They have some editing to do, so   
(00:13:02.527) ~~it's,~~ (00:13:02.647)  
it'll be fun. Yeah. Okay, cool. We're just gonna,   
(00:13:09.875) ~~I think, uh,~~(00:13:10.515)  
Evelyn, do you feel good? Yes, I think I'm good. sweet okay   
(00:13:16.157) ~~i'm gonna~~(00:13:16.817)  
i am gonna just jump right back into it so we'll just keep on rolling so business you brought up business equations as   
(00:13:22.460) ~~uh~~ (00:13:22.559)  
something you thought you wanted to talk about and i feel like business equations are as a founder something i'm   
(00:13:28.004) ~~kind of~~(00:13:28.283)  
like skeptical of because i hear people say that and then meanwhile i'm just like Who has time to sit around and think about their business equation right now? 


---


#### 00:13:35.546

I'm just trying to get the product market fit.   
(00:13:37.006) ~~You know, I'm trying to, I'm trying to like, I don't know,~~(00:13:38.827)  
sell customers and   
(00:13:39.587) ~~like~~ (00:13:39.748)  
ship product. And   
(00:13:40.609) ~~it's also~~(00:13:41.048)  
too,   
(00:13:41.249) ~~just, it's like~~(00:13:41.649)  
one of those things that I feel like this is something that sub stack writers probably talk about.   
(00:13:45.051) ~~Um, but,~~(00:13:45.711)  
but nobody that's actually building a business like actually cares about, but I I've started to change my mind about it,   
(00:13:51.254) ~~So~~ (00:13:51.293)  
I was actually excited to hear your take on it, but a couple of people I really respect are like into this. And so I love your description of what you think a business equation is and why you think it's applicable. do startups and companies that are trying to scale. 


---


#### 00:14:05.581

Now, and I think you're probably at the point of your business for the business equation gets kind of exciting. Cause I think the way I describe it is once you've had the luxury to think about how your business is going to scale, which is usually it happens after post product market fit. You start thinking about   
(00:14:19.951) ~~like,~~ (00:14:20.111)  
how am I going to take this and turn it into an actual business? And   
(00:14:22.592) ~~I think~~(00:14:22.832)  
this is usually music to all like finance people's ears, which is why I think this is something that I get really excited about because my background is in   
(00:14:29.177) ~~like~~ (00:14:29.278)  
finance and operations. So. Whenever I talk to our co-founders and my CEO about it, it's here we have a product, it's going to sell on the market, how do we turn this into an actual business?

Especially for us, a venture-funded business. And so I think the way that you really have to break it down is with the business equation, it's essentially going to give you the core set of KPIs that you're going to track against to understand what are the main levers and drivers of your business. And then   
(00:14:54.140) ~~I think~~(00:14:54.321)  
it's also going to give you a sense of what is going to be super scalable for you, what are you going to struggle with, and   
(00:14:59.363) ~~what are you going to end up~~(00:15:00.462)  
What are you going to end up sinking a lot of money against? And so for us as a SaaS business,   
(00:15:05.269) ~~I think~~(00:15:05.509)  
our business equation, like the way that I look at it, it can really see it like break down across three different teams. 


---


#### 00:15:11.289

Like you have like your marketing team, which you start looking at,   
(00:15:13.571) ~~you know,~~(00:15:13.831)  
traffic, how much of that is converting it to SQL, how much of that is converting to opportunity. And then you hit   
(00:15:19.312) ~~kind of like~~(00:15:19.652)  
the sales stage in which   
(00:15:20.692) ~~like,~~ (00:15:20.832)  
based on the number of opportunities you have, how much of it is converting based on the close rate? What's the ACV of each deal that you're signing? And then on to account management and expansion, which is what percentage of your user base is actually going to get upsold for a particular revenue tier? How much is that expansion going to be? And then eventually, how much of that is going to turn out? 


---


#### 00:15:40.861

And I think all those pieces of it become really critical parts of what your independent leaders are going to be looking at and basically trying to optimize against. And then all of that, that basically gives you like the general revenue structure of like, where are you actually getting money from your business? And essentially you have to map it against,   
(00:15:57.224) ~~you know,~~(00:15:57.484)  
what is your cost structure? And that's basically going to define for you, what is that variable percentage? What is that fixed percentage? And then what is that labor percentage? And then   
(00:16:05.288) ~~I think~~(00:16:05.528)  
with most SaaS businesses, you basically operate on these margins where your variable percentage, usually like their hosting costs and some of your servicing fees, they're small enough where you can actually spend a good amount of your time thinking about like, how do you market and acquire customers? 


---


#### 00:16:50.243

I think for most finance people, you kind of think about it innately whenever you build out the model for the business. So whenever you start thinking of one-year, three-year, five-year timelines, and you hire a finance person to go build out your business model, this is pretty much how we're thinking about your business, just not as explicitly stated. That makes sense. So then you mentioned earlier as well, like whenever you're building out the business equation or reviewing it, I'm sure there's a lot of different   
(00:17:14.901) ~~like~~ (00:17:15.040)  
leaders input into what drives into that equation. How do you or the team   
(00:17:20.904) ~~like~~ (00:17:21.065)  
balance,   
(00:17:21.806) ~~like~~ (00:17:21.986)  
let's say different opinions, right? Cause I'm sure the equation definitely has a lot of different inputs and outputs there, especially probably with finance, sales and growth teams. 


---


#### 00:17:31.333

Like how do you kind of just balance a lot of the attitudes and opinions going into driving any kind of business equation decision-making? Yeah, I think that's a great question because I think it really boils down to how people think about KPIs for their teams. And I think for better or for worse, a lot of things related to revenue generally show up pretty clearly where   
(00:17:49.829) ~~like,~~ (00:17:50.010)  
for the sales team,   
(00:17:51.352) ~~like~~ (00:17:51.471)  
your clear goal is   
(00:17:52.192) ~~like,~~ (00:17:52.311)  
how much sales are you closing? For marketing, it's   
(00:17:54.334) ~~like,~~ (00:17:54.473)  
how much lead volume are you driving? And then for kind of account management, it's   
(00:17:59.068) ~~like~~ (00:17:59.229)  
how, what is your return percentage? What is your expansion percentage? And so you usually have these core goals set across teams and it just becomes a discussion of   
(00:18:06.674) ~~like,~~ (00:18:06.875)  
how do you break down the numbers to get to your core role? 


---


#### 00:18:09.997

And I think that's kind of like the back and forth that you experienced as like a finance and ops leader, where like your role in a team is to really work with these various key stakeholders and basically figure out what is the language that we can both speak. That's going to be clear to both of us on   
(00:18:22.906) ~~like~~ (00:18:23.007)  
how we're going to goal the team and goal business. This might be a dumb question, but is there almost like a sub-equation? If I look at my company, you and maybe the founders, some of the other C-suite are thinking about the big picture, but sales or go-to-market or growth or whatever, they might be thinking about their specific variables of the equation or their sub-equation. 


---


#### 00:18:43.984

Am I thinking about this correctly? Yes, that's pretty much how you should think about it, because I think the goal is it's finance team, you're responsible for the launch and B of the business, but that's not a realistic expectation you can put on every single leader on your team. Every single leader on your team, you should really   
(00:18:57.438) ~~hone them against~~(00:18:58.057)  
what is their core business objective. So for example, for sales, sales cycles usually happen in quarterly increments. So you really want your sales leader honed in on, what am I closing this quarter and how am I going to get my team there? You don't want him to be thinking about what's going to happen in six months or a year's time. 


---


#### 00:19:13.142

Yeah. Okay, so on that point then, so you said when you first brought this up via email, you were talking about how this influences the P&L dynamics. I am not a finance person by trade, so I understand it decently, better than most maybe, but I would love to understand how this actually gets practical. Because I definitely look at my P&L on a regular basis, so I can see it in my head for my company or companies I've been at before. But   
(00:19:38.240) ~~like~~ (00:19:38.380)  
at Fremont or you can pick a different example,   
(00:19:40.840) ~~like~~ (00:19:40.961)  
what would this actually, where does this get practical where you're actually like looking at the P&L or looking at the financial model and then making decisions based on this? 


---


#### 00:19:49.744

Yeah. And I think where the P&L comes into play is really on your cost structure. So I think Hay Day is actually a really great example of this, where basically how your cost structure breaks down will influence and give you limitations on where you can spend your time and your resources. So for example, with a business like Hay Day, we are a brick and mortar business. So we have to operate on leases. We have to operate on labor and we have to operate on just shared demand volume. So then when labor gets to   
(00:20:13.999) ~~like,~~ (00:20:14.259)  
like for us, I think at Hay Day, it's like your overall gross margins are probably just around 70% of the business because 30% of it is going to be taken up by just actual labor going into the surface, actual products going into servicing   
(00:20:26.609) ~~your,~~ (00:20:27.010)  
the services that you sell. 


---


#### 00:20:29.078

And then another 30% is going to labor.   
(00:20:31.220) ~~That's another,~~(00:20:31.759)  
that's a whole like 60% of your P&L that's getting eaten up by these two components of which you're probably going to be spending a lot of time and effort basically figuring out how do you make those two components either more efficient, more inexpensive, or just. Going to scale in a way   
(00:20:45.583) ~~that's not going to,~~(00:20:46.643)  
that's not going to be necessarily linear with your overall business. Whereas   
(00:20:50.604) ~~I think~~(00:20:50.923)  
when you compare that to SAS, it's super different because usually the gross margins on SAS are insane because theoretically the only thing needed to actually scale your product is just like your hosting expenses and whatever minimal amount of labor that you need to actually service accounts. 


---


#### 00:21:05.084

And what that ends up leaving you is,   
(00:21:06.224) ~~you know,~~(00:21:06.444)  
these like 80, 90% margins in which you can basically play with in terms of   
(00:21:09.906) ~~like~~ (00:21:10.048)  
customer acquisition, in terms of building really good product. And that's really how those   
(00:21:14.651) ~~like~~ (00:21:14.770)  
cost servers that are putting into play where your largest cost buckets and the way that they scale against your business, that's where you're going to end up saving the most time. And that's going to give you the most limitation on where you can spend your excess money on. So to make this practical,   
(00:21:29.250) ~~say, but we're already making this practical, but~~(00:21:31.294)  
let's say I'm like in the SAS example, if my ACBs are like. 10K, that's probably going to limit how much money I could spend on SDRs or like how we're going to do go to market. 


---


#### 00:21:41.519

Like there's something in here of like how I'm spending my money to go acquire customers that I either can do or cannot do and how much flexibility I have with that.   
(00:21:49.563) ~~Like if I'm,~~(00:21:49.982)  
I can't hire an army of SDRs if my average customer is   
(00:21:52.784) ~~like~~ (00:21:52.903)  
paying me like four grand, I'm going to drown in and just   
(00:21:55.644) ~~like~~ (00:21:55.765)  
costs. It's going to be totally unprofitable. Correct. Yeah. For me, like with the business equation,   
(00:22:02.347) ~~like~~ (00:22:02.508)  
I love being able to get into theoretical, if you will, right? Like you're able to definitely map out anything in an Excel sheet, right? Like we can work with   
(00:22:10.144) ~~like~~ (00:22:10.244)  
a bunch of numbers, figure out a bunch of different things. 


---


#### 00:22:12.567

I've definitely had experiences where I thought if I toggled one lever, something would happen, but it ends up being a disaster or maybe a success. Do you happen to have an example at Hay Day or Vermont where you   
(00:22:23.594) ~~kind of~~(00:22:23.914)  
pull the lever thinking something was going to happen and then something else actually unexpected happened? Yeah, and   
(00:22:29.968) ~~I think~~(00:22:30.268)  
that's where part of what I really love about my job at Fermat is because I cover both finance and operations, you basically see what happens when you start pulling these levers. And a lot of times it poses pretty interesting questions about how you actually scale your operations. So I think at Fermat, one situation we came across recently is we basically realized, we figured out where we're like, okay, we feel like we're in a pretty good business, like position with our business equation where we have a general sense of how things work. 


---


#### 00:23:59.372

But then you basically see like a drop down in close rate percentage, but it's not necessarily because the leads are bad. It's just because your team isn't structured in a way to support this now sudden increased volume in leads. So it's almost like we need more SDRs. So then it's this question of, OK, does this mean that we need more SPRs? Because that's going to factor into another part of your business equation, where suddenly your variable costs are actually going to get more expensive, because you actually have more people working on this now. Yeah, I'm just thinking through this because I feel like I have all of these hypotheses of what that's going to look like for my company, but you don't really know until the rubber hits the road. 


---


#### 00:24:36.438

You've just kind of got all these estimates and things that you think will happen. So what's an example of this at heyday then? Because I feel like at heyday, the staffing model makes things totally different. How much can you really experiment when your margins are 30%? Yeah, so   
(00:24:51.424) ~~I think~~(00:24:51.685)  
that's another part of a brick-and-mortar business that you have to be really realistic about, where   
(00:24:55.368) ~~I think~~(00:24:55.788)  
when you have more limitations with your operating structure, I think you have to be much more conscious of when you do start making adjustments, because any variable adjustment in your labor percentage as part of your overall P&L, that can shrink your arrivita from 10% to 5%, which is dramatically different, especially for investors. 


---


#### 00:25:15.022

And so at Hay Day, like you probably spend less time thinking about revenue generation and you spend a lot more time thinking about cost optimization. So it's more so let's just assume we can operate at steady state and you basically are just like pumping insufficient marketing to hit your,   
(00:25:27.548) ~~you know,~~(00:25:27.848)  
for a lot of Hay Days, I think the target was like, you are operating these single digit million stores. So you're just like putting on just enough marketing in order to maintain this particular level of volume. But then you spend all your time basically thinking about,   
(00:25:40.256) ~~like,~~ (00:25:40.415)  
how do I optimize utilization where it's either you get more people to come in during the weekdays, you get more people to come in during off peak hours, and then you can hit a certain labor utilization with your stores. 


---


#### 00:25:50.441

And then that way, your overall cost basis for the labor shrinks. And that's really how you start expanding margin. You think a lot less about growth in this capacity. That makes sense.   
(00:25:59.736) ~~That makes sense.~~(00:26:00.237)  
I'm glad I'm in the SaaS business. It's   
(00:26:01.876) ~~like~~ (00:26:02.017)  
pretty much my takeaway from that. So something super interesting as well is, let me know if I'm wrong here. I believe Fermat is basically a single product, right? So with the business equation, it can be. Relatively simple, of course, definitely a lot of inputs going into it. But let's say   
(00:26:17.063) ~~we,~~ (00:26:17.223)  
you expand into another product, right? You come up with a new business line, totally different from what you're offering, but still, of course, within the same brand. 


---


#### 00:26:25.130

How do you start thinking about the business equation when it comes to maybe platforms, multi-product, marketplaces?   
(00:26:32.037) ~~I mean,~~(00:26:32.217)  
like it just gets so crazy so quickly. So we'll have to just understand   
(00:26:35.859) ~~like~~ (00:26:35.960)  
at a super high level,   
(00:26:36.901) ~~like~~ (00:26:37.020)  
how you'd even think about that. Yeah, so I think that goes to the original point about how this equation ends up breaking down into stuff that's much more granular across teams. And so for Vermont, as we really expand into becoming a platform business, like where you really see that is basically in ACV and then in expansion, because with ACVs, you end up selling these bigger deals, which you cover a lot more service areas that you're working on. 


---


#### 00:27:00.143

And then with expansion, especially as we roll out new features, you're probably selling different bundles and upsells to your various various clients that you already have in the book.   
(00:27:07.691) ~~And then,~~(00:27:07.931)  
so those become two different questions for two different teams. So for the sales team, it's going to become this thing of, okay, what is our overall ACV? What is our overall product mix? Does that balance make sense for us? And then for the account management team, it's basically thinking about what across our customer mix is actually going to get upsold. How much is that upsold going to be? How much can we realistically expect from that expansion lift? And then is that going to impact our turn numbers whatsoever? 


---


#### 00:27:31.058

Is it going to drive it up or down based on what the customer expectations are? And so those are all just like things that you want to keep a pulse on as your business gets bigger and bigger. Speaking about the business getting bigger and bigger.   
(00:27:41.823) ~~So I think something that you, or that~~(00:27:45.345)  
I want to bring up is around the idea of scaling up or scaling down your business systems.   
(00:27:49.607) ~~Right?~~ (00:27:49.828)  
So I'm sure that whenever you're thinking through the business equation, just looking through that lens, I'm sure there's a lot of optimization can happen, especially once a company reads product market fit. We'd love to understand what's an example of maybe like a Frankenstein system that you've seen that doesn't scale just whenever you were reviewing the business equation or maybe just in general when you were building out Vermont. 


---


#### 00:28:11.166

Yeah. So I think, I feel like this one doesn't exactly fit into the business equation, but the one that like I've been dealing with a lot is with our billing system. So originally when we started. We were billing entirely off of ACHs and then we were like, okay, actually, let's move to Stripe. And then we were like, actually, Stripe is really limiting in the way that we can send out invoices. So why don't we move to QuickBooks? And then we can have a quick turnaround in terms of reconciliation with our accounting systems. And then we eventually went back on Stripe because then we were starting to do all these upsells and expansions. And now   
(00:28:43.877) ~~I think~~(00:28:44.097)  
we're still in this place where we're dealing essentially with three different building platforms and basically figuring out what's the way to consolidate all of those things, where as we scale and we are selling a system where it's a platform, it's a usage, and an upsell, how do we incorporate all those things together? 


---


#### 00:28:58.364

And so that's probably a Frankenstein system that we're currently dealing with. And we're basically trying to figure out, hey, this works when we have less than 100 customers, because we realistically can still build people in a monthly cadence with this. But it's not going to work once we cross,   
(00:29:10.929) ~~you know,~~(00:29:11.670)  
even 150 or 200. So then it becomes this question of,   
(00:29:13.790) ~~like,~~ (00:29:14.010)  
how do you consolidate? And then how do you move everyone over to,   
(00:29:16.833) ~~like, kind of~~(00:29:17.173)  
a bigger system? And   
(00:29:18.414) ~~I think,~~(00:29:18.795)  
especially at the pace of Vermont's growing, we probably have to do this,   
(00:29:21.497) ~~like,~~ (00:29:21.676)  
every six months with most of our systems, where another great example is with the way that we were doing lead delegation,   
(00:29:27.320) ~~like,~~ (00:29:27.441)  
when we first started and we're getting 0 to 10 leads a week, you can probably eyeball it and be like, okay, 


---


#### 00:29:32.481

I have one AE, he's going to get all the leads and call it a day. But then as your team gets bigger and then you start getting,   
(00:29:38.542) ~~you know,~~(00:29:38.742)  
maybe 50 leads a week, then it's okay. Everybody, we have two AEs. Everyone's going to take,   
(00:29:43.585) ~~you know,~~(00:29:43.904)  
10 to 20 leads based on the lead volume. And we're just going to split it 50-50. But then now we're in the place where we know we're getting   
(00:29:49.826) ~~like~~ (00:29:49.925)  
maybe a hundred leads a week. And then we have,   
(00:29:51.605) ~~you know,~~(00:29:51.846)  
four to six AEs. And it becomes this question of   
(00:29:53.967) ~~like, have you~~(00:29:54.467)  
How do you fairly round robin your leads? And how do you do it in a way that's efficient, where people are getting leads immediately, where they know the right way to follow up? 


---


#### 00:30:03.741

You just get into a world where you can't really eyeball anything anymore. You can't really go off anecdotes. You can't really just go off of a simple math equation. You have to start thinking much more systematically. What is the fair and efficient way to do things? And then you   
(00:30:15.727) ~~kind of~~(00:30:16.007)  
have to revisit this pretty much every three to six months. So I wanted to ask you about this when we talked about the scaling business systems things, because I've definitely been on the other side of this, where you are actually scaling. And a company I was at previously, we built a ton of really complex CRM and other stuff on top of Airtable and Zapier, basically. 


---


#### 00:30:38.212

And it was amazing. It was super flexible. We did a lot of stuff with it. And then   
(00:30:43.276) ~~it,~~ (00:30:43.316)  
by the time   
(00:30:44.356) ~~we,~~ (00:30:44.497)  
we went from   
(00:30:44.957) ~~like~~ (00:30:45.096)  
one to 20 million in revenue on it. And by the time we were at   
(00:30:47.858) ~~like~~ (00:30:48.378)  
20, it was so broken.   
(00:30:49.759) ~~It were not even broken. Broken's not the right word, but~~(00:30:53.161)  
there were like three or four people in the entire company that actually understood how everything worked. And so as we were hiring people, it was so hard to   
(00:30:59.944) ~~like~~ (00:31:00.105)  
actually make any changes to it. Cause people were terrified.   
(00:31:02.385) ~~And so,~~(00:31:03.066)  
and I don't actually know how this shook out. Cause I left before we finished this, but we were trying to migrate to HubSpy and that was like awful. 


---


#### 00:31:09.169

And so I, I have. I have that scar tissue in the back of my brain. and then at the same time now like back at early stage i'm like as a so i guess like what i'm trying to ask you is   
(00:31:17.792) ~~what do you think~~(00:31:18.212)  
what is your   
(00:31:18.854) ~~as like~~(00:31:19.173)  
someone who's like an expert on finance and operations who's   
(00:31:22.015) ~~like~~ (00:31:22.154)  
seen it from both sides like what would your advice to me be on do i should i even worry about this at the early stage or can i just accept like the way i see it now is that doesn't matter because it's gonna break no matter what i do so   
(00:31:32.719) ~~i'll just i'll~~(00:31:33.400)  
fix this someday? 


---


#### 00:31:35.480

Or should I be thinking early on about just get some of these systems right now, that way it's not like misery when I hire an Evelyn to fix all of the things that I've broken?   
(00:31:44.541) ~~I think~~(00:31:45.682)  
that's a really tough question. And   
(00:31:47.123) ~~I actually think it's~~(00:31:48.262)  
actually very dependent on what system you're talking about. So   
(00:31:50.443) ~~I feel like~~(00:31:50.824)  
I can probably give you much more tactical advice depending on what particular thing you're thinking of. One thing that I actually advise a lot of operators is, especially early on for CRMs, I actually think you can get a really great deal on Salesforce. You don't have to sink a ton of money on spiffing it out and making it super fancy, which is I think the reason why a lot of people bring us Salesforce contractors.

I think out of the box, you can get a lot of functionality. I think it's not terribly hard to learn some like the basics of tooling Salesforce. And so you can usually get enough functionality and usually at a cheap enough price where you can just get started off Salesforce.   
(00:32:24.188) ~~And then,~~(00:32:24.367)  
so I feel like that was a decision I made when   
(00:32:26.288) ~~we first,~~(00:32:26.729)  
when I first joined Format and basically put in our CRM, which I was like,   
(00:32:30.471) ~~you know,~~(00:32:30.711)  
like Salesforce versus HubSpot versus these other tools,   
(00:32:33.272) ~~like.~~ (00:32:33.413)  
The cost is all largely around the same. And then I know a lot of people have been telling me that you have to hire a Salesforce developer to do all these coding for you. 


---


#### 00:32:40.105

But from my poking around, I was like, I feel like we can get by with just like the bare bones of it and not hire anyone to manage it. And   
(00:32:46.768) ~~I think~~(00:32:47.248)  
now looking at your back,   
(00:32:48.388) ~~I think~~(00:32:48.709)  
it was a great decision because I think what's enabled us to do is essentially allowed us to have the flexibility to build in Salesforce as we get bigger. So we basically avoid having that massive transition somewhere down the line where we're essentially big enough to justify it. but we've basically managed to really   
(00:33:04.316) ~~like~~ (00:33:04.455)  
limit and guardrail like the dev costs until it gets to the point where we're like, okay, with like Salesforce, it's not going to work unless we actually get someone to go do this for us. 


---


#### 00:33:13.361

And so I think it's given us the flexibility to   
(00:33:16.383) ~~kind of be like,~~(00:33:17.064)  
to   
(00:33:17.324) ~~kind of~~(00:33:17.503)  
like fence it for a bit and basically be like, okay, I don't want to build the automation. I can   
(00:33:20.945) ~~kind of~~(00:33:21.145)  
get by. And then the minute that automation becomes critical, we have the flexibility to bring someone in and just like tool it for us. And what is ultimately just going to become like the end game serum for us. How did you know that I was thinking about our CRM? I think this is a common question on Salesforce is this HubSpot. And I feel like I've had a lot of debates with my friends about it. And I know a lot of my friends who like start out with HubSpot and eventually I think 90% of them move over. 


---


#### 00:33:47.184

And then, so when I was originally making this decision, it was, it felt really hard at the time. Cause I was like, I don't know, HubSpot feels so much more user friendly. It seems like our AU seem to know how to use it. But then I think putting my finance hat on and being basically like, okay, let's just assume that Fremont does well and we're still a business in a few years time. What are we going to be on and like how expensive is it actually going to be on Salesforce in that meantime? And   
(00:34:11.177) ~~I think~~(00:34:11.617)  
basically what I'm doing is I just   
(00:34:13.579) ~~like~~ (00:34:13.699)  
took the cost basis of Hustle while I took it to our Salesforce rep and was like, 


---


#### 00:34:50.481

If I feel like my rep is not giving me what I want, I just slow down, because they feel the urgency more than I do usually. And so I'm curious, you've probably done this a few times now, what have you learned works? You're looking at these different vendors and you're trying to figure out, okay, I know what I want, but I also need to get a better deal than what's on the table now. Any things that you've learned over your last couple of companies there would be very interesting. Oh, my gosh, this is so interesting because I feel like sitting at from where I see all the different ways that our customers try to negotiate with us and then what I end up doing with our software vendors. 


---


#### 00:35:21.994

I think it's been fascinating. I feel like. I would basically bundle the tactics under three buckets. The first one is understanding your software vendor. So part of that is basically getting a sense of what are their AEs going against? What are the timelines they're working against? And one thing I found really helpful, especially for publicly traded companies such as a sales force, is if you know when their fiscal year, fiscal quarters end, that's usually the time they have the most time pressure to close a deal. And so for Salesforce, for example,   
(00:35:48.778) ~~like~~ (00:35:48.918)  
their annual, I believe their year actually ends in April or something like, or   
(00:35:52.519) ~~they,~~ (00:35:52.659)  
their year ends in January or ends in April. 


---


#### 00:35:56.001

But basically I was okay. If I negotiate the very last two weeks of April, I know they're going to be dying to close out the quarter. And then they're going to have way more flexibility with cutting me a deal versus not. So that's one thing that I've learned with just   
(00:36:08.045) ~~like~~ (00:36:08.166)  
understanding how your salesperson is getting gold. I think the second thing is basically thinking about how can you bundle the package so you get what you want at a discounted price. So usually how this starts for me is I'll usually just ask for one thing and then it becomes, okay, if I add this thing on with two licenses, can you give me a better deal across the board? 


---


#### 00:36:25.628

If I sign a two-year deal, will you give me a better deal across the board? If I promise you that we're going to get up to 10 licenses by the end of next year, can you give me a better deal? So basically just figure out a way to structure and bundle your package as a service where they're willing to cut you a deal because   
(00:36:40.489) ~~they're getting sold,~~(00:36:41.349)  
they're getting confident in expansion revenue, they're getting confident in selling you a new product, they're basically figuring that particular bucket out. And then   
(00:36:48.014) ~~I think~~(00:36:48.213)  
the third thing is definitely the more human to human side of it, of being like, hey, this is the position we're in, this is the budget I have, this is what I have to sign off on, what can you work out for this? 


---


#### 00:36:57.219

And I think for that particular one, like things I've tried before is basically, I think Rishabh, my co-founder, is like, our co-founder is very willing to play bad cop with me where he's just like, if you ever need to throw me under the bus, just do it. So there'll be times where I'm like, I can't get Rishabh to sign off on anything more than this per month or more than that per month. And then I think usually they'll just be transparent with me of like, okay, this is usually like the realm that we can go into. And I'm like, okay, I think if we get it below this, I can get him a quick sign off. 


---


#### 00:37:24.451

Otherwise we have to go through all these other hoops to approve it. And   
(00:37:27.733) ~~I think~~(00:37:27.952)  
once you say things like that, people get like very   
(00:37:30.195) ~~like~~ (00:37:30.335)  
skeezy about it. So they're like, oh, actually, let me see what I can do. So those are like the three tactics that I think I've basically tried to play against. Andrew, I was telling you, man, CEO just has to play bad cop,   
(00:37:42.884) ~~you know?~~(00:37:43.123)  
Someone must say, hey, I want to work with you so bad. You need to give me X, Y, and Z. The CEO is just like busting me. I can't do this and that. And usually you'll get what you need. Yeah, literally we were, he was giving me advice on this morning because I, 


---


#### 00:37:56.126

I'm like, we, we just, just, I literally signed before I got on here, but we've been negotiating with a couple of vendors for like weeks.   
(00:38:02.829) ~~And so,~~(00:38:03.228)  
and I'm like, I'm so new to this, but so I'm going to summarize   
(00:38:06.150) ~~what I'm,~~(00:38:06.329)  
what I'm hearing for my own sake.   
(00:38:07.710) ~~You,~~ (00:38:08.070)  
we pick the end of the quarter, like whatever timeline their deadline is against, try to be buying then.   
(00:38:14.052) ~~So,~~ (00:38:14.331)  
so if you're listening to this, if Evelyn   
(00:38:15.972) ~~is,~~ (00:38:16.072)  
is coming up to you and it's the end of the quarter, she did this on purpose.   
(00:38:19.054) ~~Half,~~ (00:38:19.213)  
half kidding. And so, end of the quarter, the second one was, I guess, the third one was have good cop, bad cop dynamic to the extent that you can. 


---


#### 00:38:27.579

And then I guess two, I think, was just this human dynamic of just be straight about what is the, leverage the human dynamic and make it clear this is the variable I want to package around. So I guess that's almost like two things, but there's the human side of it, this is what I care about, and then there's the packaging of, I really want this specific variable to, it could just be your per seat cost. And so try to structure the contract around that. Yeah, I would say the last category is actually   
(00:38:53.012) ~~much,~~ (00:38:53.132)  
much bigger in the sense that it's bundling packaging from their end and your end. So you also have a realm of things that you can offer them. 


---


#### 00:38:58.773

So either that's customer referrals, whether that's doing a case study for them. Those are all the things that I've been willing to put on the table where I'm just like, hey, if I'm willing to be an advocate for you in a situation that you and me at the software work out, will that give me anything here either. Interesting. Yeah. Like leverage the case study.   
(00:39:15.721) ~~I'm not,~~(00:39:16.380)  
that's a good idea actually. I feel like more companies should definitely do that. We used to do that first base, but frankly speaking, every vendor we ever promised to do a case study, we would follow up with them saying, Hey,   
(00:39:25.829) ~~like we're down,~~(00:39:26.429)  
we're ready to do it. And we'd never hear anything. 


---


#### 00:39:29.192

So I think it's just like a freebie that you can like promise. And most people don't want to follow up. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. I would be, if I was running whatever company you bought from and offered a case study and they didn't take it up, I would be firing that marketing team. Personally, that's just like, who's missing out on a case study when the company's down to do it?   
(00:39:47.764) ~~That's just,~~(00:39:48.144)  
it's crazy to me. So this has been great. I want to end on, I have one last question for you and then we'll   
(00:39:52.887) ~~kind of like~~(00:39:53.248)  
transition and close it up. But   
(00:39:54.769) ~~I feel like~~(00:39:55.190)  
with a lot of the stuff we've talked about, 


---


#### 00:39:56.510

I feel like with your role, especially like a roughly series A-ish stage company, you guys are kind of starting that scaling journey. You're like running ops and finance.   
(00:40:06.974) ~~I, my,~~(00:40:07.313)  
my perspective looking at it is   
(00:40:08.795) ~~like,~~ (00:40:08.875)  
it seems like you're the arbiter of,   
(00:40:10.476) ~~uh, you're like~~(00:40:11.695)  
the check and balance against   
(00:40:13.177) ~~like,~~ (00:40:13.317)  
how is this thing actually working as a business?   
(00:40:16.018) ~~Do you,~~(00:40:16.398)  
do you think that's like a care?   
(00:40:17.739) ~~I guess,~~(00:40:17.960)  
how would you characterize that? Do you think you do a lot of this? Like where, Hey, this thing is not actually working. The numbers don't line up or this is broken.   
(00:40:25.202) ~~Is that,~~(00:40:25.663)  
do you think that's like a fair characterization of a lot of what your role ends up ends up being at this stage? 


---


#### 00:40:31.186

I think so. I think to term our CMO, Roba calls me the arbiter or the tether to reality. So   
(00:40:37.398) ~~I think~~(00:40:37.739)  
I'm basically the constant check that we are actually running in potentially profitable business one day. Yeah, profitable business. Things that didn't matter two years ago that matter very much today. So on that note,   
(00:40:50.130) ~~where should people,~~(00:40:51.271)  
anybody listening to this, looking at this on LinkedIn, all that good stuff, where should we send people? I saw that you're hiring a couple folks. What should people check out? Where should people go? Yeah, so we're always hiring for a team. So   
(00:41:03.440) ~~I think~~(00:41:04.059)  
everything is pretty much on our website. So for mockcommerce.com, if you're interested in checking out our product, you can book a demo there.

#### 00:41:09.762

You can also look at our drop board. And yeah, people should feel free to reach out to me as well. I think it's just Evelyn at for mockcommerce.com.   
(00:41:18.836) ~~Huge.~~ (00:41:19.056)  
  
(00:41:19.097) ~~And then we'll link your LinkedIn profile as well. I don't believe you're on Twitter. I couldn't find you on Twitter. So yeah, we'll link, we'll link the posted to some of the roles you're hiring for. We'll link up for Mod, we'll link your LinkedIn and then yeah,~~(00:41:30.670)  
I appreciate you coming on. This was super fun and we'll have to do it again sometime. Yeah, indeed. Thank you Andrew and Ramil for having me. Thanks everyone.

Amelie Schreiber, computational biochemist and AI researcher. Welcome to the Cognitive Revolution. Nice to be here. I'm excited for this conversation. I expect to learn a lot from it. This all started with a tweet that I saw you put out where you said, here are my top 10 AI tools for biology. And I read down the list and I was like, I don't know what any of these are. So   
(00:00:23.425) ~~I think~~(00:00:23.626)  
pretty much immediately just say, Hey, would you be interested in educating me in the form of a podcast? So I appreciate you taking the time. You want to start off by just giving a little bit of context on who you are, what you're doing day to day and what kinds of problems you're trying to solve.

Yeah, sure. I'm an AI researcher and I focus on computational biochemistry applications. I actually started out as a mathematician. My training in grad school was in mathematics, actually. Started off with pure mathematics and then transitioned into applied mathematics and data analysis. And then after grad school, I got into deep learning and started working on more AI related things. For me, the biochemistry applications are one of the most compelling things that we could be working on right now.

AGI, whatever that means, I think it's probably the most important problem we can be working on because it's a huge impact on human health. the applications are really profound and have the potential to be very impactful for everyone.

So I get really excited about the biochemistry applications of AI. I have some projects and things that I'm working on that are more related to environmental things and material science type applications, but Primarily I focus on the medical or biomedical aspect of things. Okay, so let me try to give a extremely high level understanding of a couple of the biggest problems that are being studied in biomedical sciences. As I was preparing for this, I was having a good conversation with CLOB3 about it. And I came away with the understanding that both at the level of an individual cell, and then again, at the level of the overall organism system, We have one really massive challenge, which is that we don't know how it works.

We've got the DNA, which is the code, the RNA, which is both messenger, but also is a machine. The proteins are all machines that fold up in weird ways and interact with each other in three-dimensional space. And then you've got the small molecules as well, which are like signaling, but also if they fit right,   
(00:02:26.073) ~~you know,~~(00:02:26.233)  
all these puzzle pieces fit together in super strange ways. There's this incredible network of interactions where things are disabling each other or promoting each other or interacting in all sorts of complicated ways. The nature of those interactions initially was entirely unclear. And now humanity at large has embarked on this grand project of trying to figure out how do cells work and how do our bodies work.

And I'm gathering we're like maybe five to 10% of the way there. Most of the interactions remain unknown to us, but we've at least mapped out a decent chunk. So the first challenge, if you're trying to solve a disease is figure out what is the pathway? What is the interaction in this   
(00:03:03.596) ~~like~~ (00:03:03.795)  
super complicated thing that is going wrong? And then the second challenge is if I know what is going wrong, can I do something to intervene to stop it? But then again, there could be a lot of other knock-on effects. And in that way, there's an important commonality with large language models. These things are not super clean. In language models, people are probably familiar with the notion of superposition, which is one activation in a network. can light up for multiple different reasons.
